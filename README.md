# PicViewer

This is a VB.NET WinForm application that I quickly put together. I did this because I wanted a less cluttered look with borderless windows and the ability to pin an image at any location on a multi monitor setup.

#Build Requirements
- Microsoft Visual Studio 2017
- Microsoft Windows 10

#Miscellaneous
- One 256x256 PNG was created with Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 and was fed through icoconvert.com to produce all icon sizes in one multi-res file
